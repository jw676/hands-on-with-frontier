# Basics of AI/ML Development

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, we are witnessing a remarkable transformation in how we interact with our devices and information. One of the most visible manifestations of this change is the rise of AI chatbots and virtual assistants, which have become universal tools in our daily lives. 

Artificial intelligence has transitioned from a niche area of study to a fundamental component of various industries, impacting everything from art and history to science and finance. 

Just as the internet revolutionized communication and information sharing, AI is now paving the way for enhanced efficiency, personalized experiences, and innovative solutions to complex problems. As a result, understanding the principles of AI is no longer optional; itâ€™s essential for anyone looking to thrive in the modern world!

In this course we will explore how to use a subset of artificial intelligence called machine learning (ML). While AI can be used broadly to describe any form of a computer performing tasks that normally require human intelligence, ML focuses on developing algorithms that make predictions based on data. The objectives of this course is to teach you how to:

1. Preprocess an example data set
2. Train an ML model
3. Evaluate a trained ML model

## Setting up Jupyter Notebooks on Odo

We will be using Jupyter notebooks on Odo in this course (opposed to directly intefacing with Odo like in other challenges). However, you will first need to make sure this repository is in your home directory on Odo before beginning. If you have not already done this, please refer to [`Access_Odo_and_Clone_Repo`](../Access_Odo_and_Clone_Repo)

### Logging in to the JupyterHub

1. Navigate to: https://jupyter-open.olcf.ornl.gov/hub/login
2. Log in with the same XCAMS username and password you used for logging into Odo.
3. In the folder explorer (left sidebar) navigate to the challenge directory.
    * `/ccsopen/home/userid/hands-on-with-odo/challenges/AI_Basics`
4. Open the "Tutorial.ipynb" to get started!
